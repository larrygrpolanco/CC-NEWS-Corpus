# Washington Post Processing Notes

## Findings
- No Washington Post articles were found in the January 2025 Common Crawl data (CC-MAIN-2025-05)
- Attempted to filter cluster.idx for Washington Post politics URLs, but found no results

## Attempts
1. Downloaded collinfo.json to identify relevant crawl collection (CC-MAIN-2025-05)
2. Downloaded cc-index.paths.gz and decompressed it
3. Downloaded cluster.idx from CC-MAIN-2025-05
4. Ran `grep` on cluster.idx to filter for Washington Post politics URLs

## Next Steps
- Try processing data from other news sources or timeframes
- Consider checking if Washington Post allows crawling in their robots.txt

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of checking multiple sources and timeframes
- Usefulness of documenting attempts and findings for future troubleshooting
