## Current Focus
- Validating extracted data from WARC files
- Expanding publisher-specific parsers (Reuters, AP)

## Recent Progress
- Implemented WARC file processor
- Developed and tested Washington Post parser
- Updated documentation framework
- Organized project data into a structured directory

## Directory Structure
The project data is now organized into the following structure:
- data/
  - cc-index/
    - cc-index.paths
    - cluster.idx
  - warc-files/
    - washington_post_article_content.warc
    - washington_post_article.warc.gz

## Next Steps
1. Validate the accuracy of the extracted data for Washington Post articles.
2. Develop parsers for Reuters and AP news articles.
3. Implement performance benchmarking for the WARC processing pipeline.

By completing these next steps, we'll continue to advance the project's goals and improve the overall quality of the CC-NEWS corpus processing pipeline.
