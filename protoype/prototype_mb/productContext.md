# Prototypes Memory Bank - Product Context

## Purpose
This document provides context for the prototype development process, explaining why we're building these prototypes and how they fit into the larger project.

## Key Information
- **Project Goal**: Develop modular components for processing CC-NEWS data
- **Prototype Purpose**: Test and validate processing pipeline components
- **Current Focus**: Implementing WARC file processing and publisher-specific parsers
- **Recent Achievements**: Developed a WARC file processor and a customized parser for Washington Post articles
- **Next Steps**: Validate extracted data, consider adding more metadata, and implement performance benchmarking

## Project Progress
The project has made significant progress in developing modular components for CC-NEWS data processing. The WARC file processor is functional, and a parser for Washington Post articles has been implemented. These components are designed to be reusable and adaptable for other publishers.

## Future Directions
1. Validate the accuracy of the extracted data.
2. Expand parser development to other major news publishers.
3. Enhance the WARC processing pipeline with performance optimizations.

By continuing to develop and refine these prototypes, we aim to create a robust and scalable solution for processing CC-NEWS data.
