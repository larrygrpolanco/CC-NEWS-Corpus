Notes on brookings.edu website structure

Root site: www.brookings.edu/

All article routes: www.brookings.edu/articles/*

Articles urls follow kebab case e.g., https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-us-tariffs-on-north-american-auto-manufacturing-and-implications-for-usmca/

What I have gathered from the website structure so far:
Articles can be of a few types eit 
- Resaerch 
- Commentary
- Commentary Podcast

There is some descrepency in formatting I cannot find the pattern yet
- Sometimes bullet summaries are given for the article
- Formatting of the article itself can vary slightly
My guess is that there is some freedom given to the authors or it is connected to the topic.

There is a place in the HTML with topic data e.g.,

	var brookings = window.brookings || {};
	brookings.dataLayer = {"title":"Are America\u2019s alliances a source of strength or a burden as it competes with China?","archived":"No","author":"Brian Blankenship, Doug Bandow, Emilie Kimball, Mireya Sol\u00eds, Patricia M. Kim, Ryan Hass, Thomas Wright","author_id":"32681, 32680, 22356, 29167, 28544, 28702, 1314","author_type":"Guest Author, Guest Author, Staff, Expert, Expert, Expert, Expert","language":"en","word_count":3535,"historical_url":"","original_post_id":1819203,"post_id":1819203,"parent":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15","type":"","content_type":"Commentary","format":"","subtype":"","primary_topic":"China","topic":"International Affairs, U.S. Foreign Policy","region":"Asia & the Pacific, China","program":"Foreign Policy","project":"Global China Project","center":"John L.

This data will be vital for keeping clear records on the corpus and for running analysis

Some of this information can be found in text form on the page for example every page has a More On section linking to related topic pages, however this brookings.dataLayer is gold

Here is another one for more reference

	var brookings = window.brookings || {};
