# Product Context: Brookings Institution Corpus

## Why This Project Exists
- To enable rigorous, reproducible research on persuasive language and descriptive features in influential think tank articles, specifically from the Brookings Institution.
- To provide a high-quality, well-documented dataset for both descriptive and advanced linguistic analysis, supporting research questions in political communication, public policy, and computational linguistics.

## Problems It Solves
- Overcomes the challenge of extracting structured, reliable metadata and main text from a large, heterogeneous web archive (Common Crawl).
- Avoids rate limiting and inefficiency by working locally with targeted index files, minimizing unnecessary downloads.
- Provides a reproducible, scalable workflow for future corpus updates or extensions to other sources.

## How It Should Work
- Researchers can efficiently extract, validate, and analyze Brookings articles from a specific Common Crawl snapshot.
- The pipeline produces a standardized metadata table and cleaned text files, ready for downstream analysis.
- All steps are documented, version-controlled, and reproducible, with clear configuration and schema.

## User Experience Goals
- **Transparency:** Every step, from index filtering to metadata extraction, is documented and reproducible.
- **Efficiency:** Only necessary files are downloaded and processed, saving time and resources.
- **Validation:** Extraction is validated against the live website and through manual spot-checks.
- **Extensibility:** The workflow can be adapted for other sources or future crawls with minimal changes.
- **Trustworthiness:** The resulting corpus is suitable for publication, sharing, and further research.

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Researchers in linguistics, political science, and public policy.
- Secondary: Developers building tools for web-scale text analysis, and future maintainers of the corpus pipeline.
