**A Glimpse into Digital Research: The Brookings Corpus Project**

Step into the world of large-scale digital scholarship. This project is an exploration of the Brookings Institution's articles, carefully unearthed from the vast layers of the Common Crawl web archive. Our goal: to build a trustworthy, reproducible collection of texts and metadata, opening new doors for research on language, persuasion, and public policy.

The journey begins with the art of digital archaeology—sifting through billions of web records to find every Brookings article, then extracting their raw HTML with precision and care. What you see here is the living record of that process: scripts, logs, and documentation, all working together to transform a mountain of web data into a curated research corpus.

**Current Status:**  
The project has moved from planning and pilot tests to full-scale extraction, now harnessing the power of cloud computing for speed and reliability. Soon, the focus will shift to parsing, validation, and assembling a pilot dataset for deeper analysis.

**Next Steps:**  
- Complete extraction of all Brookings articles as raw HTML.
- Develop tools to parse rich metadata and main text.
- Validate and assemble a pilot corpus for research.

This is not just a technical endeavor, but a story of method, rigor, and discovery—an evolving piece in the museum of digital research.
